PART 3 LLM CAPABILITIES (New Features)
--------------------------------------

1. LLM-BASED PARSING
   Test: Load the recipe URL and verify it parses correctly with LLM
   Expected: Structured recipe with ingredients, steps, tools, methods extracted

2. INTENT CLASSIFICATION
   Test these to verify LLM correctly classifies intents:
   
   - "how do I preheat an oven?" (should be "how_to", not "temperature")
   - "what temperature?" (should be "temperature")
   - "can I use milk instead?" (should be "substitution")
   - "what is cottage cheese?" (should be "what_is")
   - "next step" (should be "navigation")
   - "how much beef?" (should be "quantity")

3. STATE TRACKING FROM DIALOGUE
   Test sequence:
   - Load recipe
   - Say: "next" (should go to step 2)
   - Say: "how long do I cook the beef?" (LLM should infer you're on step 3)
   - Say: "what do I do next?" (LLM should understand context from previous steps)

4. QUESTION ANSWERING WITH CONTEXT
   Test these open-ended questions:
   
   - "why do I need to cook the noodles first?"
   - "can I skip the eggs in the cottage cheese mixture?"
   - "do I need to cover the lasagna while it bakes?"
   - "what happens if I don't let it stand before serving?"
   - "can I make this ahead of time?"
   - "why do we layer it that way?"
   - "what's the difference between cottage cheese and ricotta in lasagna?"

5. YOUTUBE SEARCH INTEGRATION
   Test "how-to" questions (should provide explanation + YouTube link):
   
   - "how do I preheat an oven?"
   - "how do I cook ground beef?"
   - "how do I layer lasagna?"
   - "how do I know when the lasagna is done?"
   - "how do I drain pasta?"
   - "how do I do that?" (after being shown a step with a technique)

6. OUT-OF-SCOPE DETECTION
   Test these (should be politely rejected):
   
   - "what's the weather today?"
   - "tell me a joke"
   - "what's 2+2?"
   - "who won the game last night?"

7. CONTEXTUAL QUESTIONS
   Test questions that require recipe context:
   
   - "how much did you say I need?" (referring to previous conversation)
   - "what step am I on?"
   - "what ingredients are in this step?"
   - "what tools do I need for this step?"
   - "can I do this step ahead of time?"

8. COMPLEX REASONING
   Test LLM's ability to reason about the recipe:
   
   - "if I want to make half the recipe, how much ground beef do I need?"
   - "can I use Italian sausage instead of ground beef?"
   - "can I freeze this lasagna?"
   - "how long will leftovers keep in the fridge?"
   - "what if I don't have whole wheat noodles?"

9. TECHNIQUE EXPLANATIONS
   Test LLM's cooking knowledge:
   
   - "what does 'al dente' mean?"
   - "what does 'crumbly' mean when cooking beef?"
   - "why do we let it stand before serving?"
   - "what's the difference between baking and broiling?"

10. AMBIGUOUS QUESTIONS
    Test LLM's ability to clarify:
    
    - "what is that?" (after showing a step)
    - "how much?" (without specifying ingredient)
    - "can I use something else?" (without context)

TESTING SEQUENCE
----------------

Recommended order for comprehensive testing:

1. Load recipe URL
2. Test navigation (next, back, step numbers)
3. Test basic questions (time, temp, quantity)
4. Test substitution questions
5. Test "how-to" questions (verify YouTube links appear)
6. Test open-ended questions
7. Test out-of-scope questions
8. Test contextual questions (with conversation history)
9. Test ambiguous questions

EXPECTED BEHAVIORS
-----------------

For "how-to" questions:
✓ LLM provides explanation (2-4 sentences)
✓ YouTube search link is provided
✓ Explanation is context-aware (mentions recipe-specific details when relevant)

For substitution questions:
✓ LLM provides helpful alternatives
✓ Mentions any recipe-specific considerations
✓ Stays grounded in recipe context

For out-of-scope questions:
✓ Polite rejection message
✓ Redirects to recipe/cooking topics

For contextual questions:
✓ Uses conversation history
✓ References previous steps/ingredients mentioned
✓ Maintains awareness of current step

For state tracking:
✓ Infers current step from dialogue
✓ Handles implicit step changes
✓ Falls back to Python tracking if LLM unavailable

SPECIFIC TEST CASES FOR LASAGNA RECIPE
--------------------------------------

Based on the recipe structure:

1. "How do I preheat an oven to 350 degrees?"
   Expected: Explanation of preheating + YouTube link

2. "How long do I cook the ground beef?"
   Expected: "About 10 minutes" (from step 3)

3. "Can I use regular lasagna noodles instead of whole wheat?"
   Expected: LLM explains substitution, mentions any adjustments needed

4. "Why do I need to let it stand before serving?"
   Expected: LLM explains it allows lasagna to set, prevents it from falling apart

5. "What if I don't have cottage cheese?"
   Expected: LLM suggests ricotta as substitute, explains differences

6. "How do I know when the lasagna is done?"
   Expected: LLM explains visual cues (bubbling, melted cheese, browning)

7. "Can I assemble this the night before?"
   Expected: LLM discusses make-ahead options, storage considerations

8. "What's the difference between the two baking times?"
   Expected: LLM explains covered vs uncovered baking, why both are needed
